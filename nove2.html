  <h1>In the Lapse of Lost Memory</h1>
  
  <h2>Chapter One: Recognition</h2>

<p>The university bus stop was always crowded in the evenings. A restless tide of students pressed together, clutching bags, books, and phones, all waiting for the same lumbering buses to carry them back to scattered corners of the city.</p>

<p>Above them, the sky stretched in molten colors — orange and crimson spilling into each other as if the day itself were painting its farewell. For Seya, this view was always her favorite. The dying light seemed to celebrate endurance: the hardships borne through long hours, the quiet victories, the bruises carried without complaint. Then it folded itself gently into goodbye, promising another chance tomorrow.</p>

<p>But tonight the sky held a different weight.</p>

<p>That was when she saw him.</p>

<p>At first, it was just a face in the crowd — one among dozens. But something about the angle of his walk, the rhythm of his step, the way his gaze seemed to move before his body followed… it felt familiar in a way that made her breath hitch. Her memory could not place him. Her mind offered no name, no reason. And yet her chest tightened as if she had stumbled upon a piece of her own reflection.</p>

<p>The crowd thinned for a heartbeat, and he was closer now. His dark eyes swept across the bus stop, searching for nothing in particular. When they landed on her, the world seemed to still.</p>

<p class="convo">“Hey… did we ever meet? Why do I feel like I know you?”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled between curiosity and fear.</p>

<p>He paused, startled, then looked at her with a gaze that was steady but unreadable.</p>

<p class="convo">“No,” he said flatly. “We never met.”</p>

<p>One word. No.<br>
It should have ended there.</p>

<p>But something beneath the surface refused. Her chest constricted; her heart resisted. It whispered against reason: You know him. You’ve always known him.</p>

<p class="convo">“Oh…”</p>

<p>Her lips curved into a small, fragile smile she didn’t feel. She dropped her gaze, staring at the ground as the crowd pressed and shifted around her. The ache that rose inside her was sharp, as though her body remembered what her mind had been forced to forget.</p>

<p>And somewhere — unseen, unacknowledged — the other Seya stirred.</p>

<p>From a different timeline, a different dimension, she watched the moment unfold through a fractured mirror of existence.<br>
She remembered the command:</p>

<p><em>I will bear this burden of memories for you so that you can keep living. But keep the end of the bargain.</em></p>

<p>The ledger of costs. Memory was a currency. You traded it to protect a life that mattered more than the ache. Love was not a reason to end yourself.</p>

<p>The encounter ripped through her like lightning. Her body remembered the heat of his hand in hers, the weight of his arm around her shoulders, the stolen laughter in twilight parks. Every memory she had given away, every sacrifice made to cut him out, came roaring back — not as images, but as pain.</p>

<p>It was unbearable. Her chest burned as if she were being split open all over again. The heartbreak she had once buried surged fresh and raw, as though the erasure had been nothing but a thin bandage over a wound that never healed.</p>

<p>How could the heart still remember what the mind had chosen to destroy?</p>

<p>She wanted to scream across dimensions — to warn, to weep, to demand the world return what was taken. But she could not. She had made the bargain, sealed the doorway with the currency of her memories. And now, as punishment, she was condemned to feel everything the other Seya could not: the longing without reason, the grief without context.</p>

<p>The erased Seya stood silently at the bus stop, forcing her smile.<br>
Something inside her was dead and gone. She didn’t look back to see his cold shoulder, nor did she cling to him.</p>

<p>Instead, she turned to the sunset. A voice inside her whispered:<br>
<em>If you feel lost, remember why you chose to live.</em></p>

<p>And she remembered: her mother telling her to be careful on her way back, the warmth of her smile. A real smile touched Seya’s lips at last. The bus arrived, and she stepped on board.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the other Seya’s ribs felt as though they were being crushed in a vice. She remembered — through fractured time, bent edges — memories so powerful they were the very medicine humans carried to survive their longest nights.</p>

<p>Even erased, love left its traces. Maybe it ran so deep in some that they shattered the most when abandoned.</p>

<p>It was agony without release, the kind of pain that carved itself into bone.<br>
Even after the heartbreak.<br>
Even after the betrayal.<br>
Even after the shattering silence.</p>

<p>The heart — stubborn, reckless, merciless — still recognized his presence.</p>

<p>And so, two Seyas stood at the threshold of the same moment:<br>
one who remembered too little, and one who remembered too much.</p>
